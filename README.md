# Linked List Project – Algorithm & Data Structures (C)

This project implements a special singly linked list in C.  
Each node contains:
- a real number,
- the number of occurrences of this value,
- a pointer to the next node.

If a value already exists in the list, its occurrence counter is incremented.  
Otherwise, a new node is created.
