# Linked List Project – Algorithm & Data Structures (C)

This project implements a *special singly linked list* in C.  
Each node stores:
- a real number (double),
- the number of occurrences (an integer),
- a pointer to the next node.

When inserting a value:
- if it already exists in the list, its occurrence counter is incremented;
- otherwise, a new node is appended (or inserted according to your chosen policy).

The library exposes a small API to initialize and manipulate the list, display it, count elements (considering occurrences), search and remove values.
